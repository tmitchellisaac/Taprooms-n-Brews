# Welcome to Taprooms 'n' Brews #
(created from info on some breweries in the Denver area)

Things you may want to cover:
1. Use Ruby version 3.2.2 and Rails version 7.0.8
2. Database creation and seeding-
  -  there are seeds in the seed file that should create enough examples to start with, of both Taprooms and their Brews.
  -  create the database and seed by running rails dc:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
3. To run the test suite type `bundle exec rspec spec/models` to test the models and `bundle exec rspec spec/features` to test the features
4. To run the app enter `rails s` into your terminal after cloning the repo and entering the correct directory
5. Have fun, feel free to add some brews!
